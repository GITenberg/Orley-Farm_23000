description: "Orley Farm is a novel written in the realist mode by Anthony Trollope\
  \ (1815–82), and illustrated by the Pre-Raphaelite artist John Everett Millais (1829–96).\
  \ It was first published in monthly shilling parts by the London publisher Chapman\
  \ and Hall. Although this novel appeared to have undersold (possibly because the\
  \ shilling part was being overshadowed by magazines, such as The Cornhill, that\
  \ offered a variety of stories and poems in each issue), Orley Farm became Trollope's\
  \ personal favourite. George Orwell said the book contained \"one of the most brilliant\
  \ descriptions of a lawsuit in English fiction.\"\nThe house in the book was based\
  \ on a farm in Harrow once owned by the Trollope family. The real-life farm became\
  \ a school, which was originally supposed to be the feeder school to Harrow School.\
  \ It was renamed Orley Farm School after the novel, with Trollope's permission.\n\
